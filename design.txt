At every frame, an enemy will have to decide whether to change their status, or remain in their
current status. Then they will follow the script for that status.

Enemy type: fighter
Attack script: Move towards the character until one is close enough, and then attack
Retreat script: Move away from the character when shields are low to recover


Enemy type: lobber
Attack script: Move towards the character until they're in range, then throw grenade.


Enemy type: Sky bombs. They just fall from the sky and need to be dodged
